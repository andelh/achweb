As a frontend developer, reveal animations are a simple but effective way to include delight in your end userâ€™s experience. Itâ€™s a method of having content appear on screen just-in-time as they scroll through your website â€” and with control over the entry animation, youâ€™re able to pull off some nifty and fluid [transitions.](http://transitions.in)

In this post, I will teach you how to add some simple reveal animations to your website, specifically with NextJS, Framer Motion and Styled Components.

> You can just as easily follow along this tutorial without using styled-components. I do recommend it though as a method of writing re-usable CSS components.

### What weâ€™re building

**Intended audience**
This tutorial is best suited for developers with beginner - intermediate knowledge of React, who are looking to improve the look and feel of their websites.

At the end of this tutorial, you should be equipped with everything you need to add scroll-based reveal animations to your next project â€” or even to spruce up your existing websites. We will be exploring some basics techniques of the Framer Motion animation library to build a simple text and image UI.

### Framer Motion

\*consider adding a bit of personableness to this. For e.g. Iâ€™ve created a boilerplate which includes a motion library for us to start working with. This will make it easier for you to get started.

Being personable will make it less instructive and more inclusive for the user thatâ€™s learning. They feel like they have a partner vs being told what they should do

Framer motion is a motion library for React that feels like magic. It allows developers to easily add enter and exit animations, and animations based on some state for just about any css property. Itâ€™s API is well written and [well documented](https://www.framer.com/docs/introduction/) with tons of [examples](https://www.framer.com/docs/examples/).

Since **v5.3**, they have introduced a `whileInView` prop that allows you to perform animations based on an elementâ€™s visibility in the viewport â€” also known as scroll based animations.

### Getting Started

Iâ€™ve created a repo for us to use as our starting point for getting started. Create your own fork of the [andelh/framer-motion-reveal repo](https://github.com/andelh/framer-reveal-animations). It is a boilerplate NextJs app with a few elements added for us to animate. Feel free to check out the `final` branch to see the what we will be achieving in the end.

The repo includes the following notable dependencies:

- framer-motion
- styled-components

Okay now that weâ€™re all set, letâ€™s get started!

## It all starts with a Hero

Our first section to tackle is the [Hero](https://www.awebco.com/blog/hero-section/) Section. It contains just two text elements:

- `Title` - an h1 element
- `Copy` - a paragraph element

We will add a simple entry animation to this section since these elements are seen as soon as you land on the page.

To begin, turn both of the styled components into `motion` elements.

When using `styled-components`, we can achieve this like so:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    // Standard styled elements
    const Title = styled.h1${"`"}
      font-size: 60px;
      font-weight: bold;
    ${"`"}
    const Copy = styled.p${"`"}
      margin-bottom: 25vh;
    ${"`"}
    // Framer motion styled elements
    const Title = styled(motion.h1)${"`"}
      font-size: 60px;
      font-weight: bold;
    ${"`"}
    const Copy = styled(motion.p)${"`"}
      margin-bottom: 25vh;
    ${"`"}
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

When using HTML, you can just convert the tag to one of Framerâ€™s replacement elements like so:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    <!--Standard HTML elements-->
    <h1>A Superb and Extended Title</h1>
    <p>Some copy</p>
    
    <!--Framer Elements-->
    <motion.h1>A Superb and Extended Title</motion.h1>
    <motion.p>Some copy</motion.p>
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

### Animating the text

Now letâ€™s add our simple entry animation. With framer, we can do this using just three props on our motion components:

- `initial` - describes the animations state that the component should be in when it mounts. Any CSS property can be passed into this object such as `opacity` and `backgroundColor`.
- `animate` - describes to animation state that we want to transition to. By default, the _from_ part of the animation is described in the `initial` prop. from the initial. We can also use state values here to trigger different animation states. Weâ€™ll see an example of this later.
- `transition` - helps us describe how we wish to present our animation, with options for the duration, delay, easing and more.

With this in mind, letâ€™s animate our components!

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    <Title
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  >
      A Superb and Extended Title
    </Title>
    <Copy
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
    >
      The most powerful MacBook Pro ever is here. With the blazing-fast M1
      Pro or M1 Max chip â€” the first Apple silicon designed for pros â€” you
      get groundbreaking performance and amazing battery life. Add to that a
      stunning Liquid Retina XDR display, the best camera and audio ever in
      a Mac notebook, and all the ports you need. The first notebook of its
      kind, this MacBook Pro is a beast.
    </Copy>
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

This is nice, but we can make it better. Using the transition prop, letâ€™s adjust the `duration` and `delay` so that the text elements appear one after the other.

```jsx
<Title
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{
            duration: 1.5,
            delay: 0.4,
          }}
        >
          A Superb and Extended Title
        </Title>
        <Copy
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{
            duration: 1.5,
            delay: 0.7,
          }}
        >
          The most powerful MacBook Pro ever is here. With the blazing-fast M1
          Pro or M1 Max chip â€” the first Apple silicon designed for pros â€” you
          get groundbreaking performance and amazing battery life. Add to that a

          a Mac notebook, and all the ports you need. The first notebook of its
          kind, this MacBook Pro is a beast.
        </Copy>
```

[Easings.net](http://Easings.net) is a handy website for getting different easing previews to apply to your animation. Find one you like and add it to the transition prop in an array:

```jsx
<Title
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{
            duration: 1.5,
            delay: 0.4,
            ease: [0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1], // easings.net
          }}
        >
          A Superb and Extended Title
        </Title>
        <Copy
          initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
          animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
          transition={{
            duration: 1.5,
            delay: 0.7,
            ease: [0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1], // easings.net
          }}
        >

Lookin good chap! Letâ€™s move on to the next section

## The Gallery Section

First things first, weâ€™ll convert everything in the section to motion elements. *You should be a pro at this by now ðŸ˜‰*Â [link to section above].

With this done, we can add our animations. Letâ€™s re-use the `Title` animation properties from above for our `Heading` element.

This time though, we will have some fun and utilize Framerâ€™s `whileInView` prop. Switch out the `animate` prop for the `whileInView` prop and now, the animation happens only when the element is in view! Scroll around the page a few times to give it a try.

```jsx
<Heading
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 50 }}
  whileInView={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  viewport={{
    once: false,
    amount: "all",
  }}
  transition={{
    duration: 1.5,
    delay: 0.4,
    ease: [0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1],
  }}
>
  Here is a simple gallery reveal
</Heading>
```

[gif preview]

### The `viewport` prop

With the `whileInView` prop applied, you gain access to the `viewport` prop which lets you adjust a few things about how your animation interacts with the...viewport (duh).

**Here are a few key ones**
`once` : boolean

If `true`, the animation described will happen every single time the element comes into view

`margin`: string

A margin to add to the viewport when detecting whether the element has entered it. Useful for delaying the triggering of a viewport animation until more of the element is shown. A single value can be used to add a margin on every side, e.g.Â **`"200px"`**. Or, multiple values can be defined to assign a margin to each axis in the order of top/right/bottom/left, e.g.Â **`"0px -20px 0px 100px"`**.

`amount`: "some" | "all" | number

Defaults toÂ **`"some"`**, this option defines the amount of the element that has to intersect with the viewport in order for it to be considered within view. When using a number, 0 represents none and 1 represents all of the element.

### Animating the images

To your `motion.img` element, apply the following animation settings. Itâ€™s similar to what weâ€™ve been using before, but here we use a scaling animation for the reveal instead. Play around with the `once` prop here to see which style you prefer!

```jsx
...
<Gallery>
          {images.map((image, index) => (
            <Image
              initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.9 }}
              whileInView={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
              viewport={{
                once: false,
                amount: 0.9,
                // amount?: "some" | "all" | number;
              }}
              transition={{
                duration: 1.5,
                delay: 0.4,
                ease: [0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1],
              }}
              src={`https://picsum.photos/seed/${index}/230`}
            />
          ))}
</Gallery>
...
```

## The List Section

For our list reveal, we want each item to gradually appear one after the other. To do this, we will set up something known as variants in Framer. You can think of variants as a way of describing different animation states in an object, so that you can refer to them in your JSX later on. They also allow you to _create animations that propagate throughout the DOM, and orchestrate them in a declarative way._

Before we get started, make sure youâ€™ve converted all the elements in this section to `motion` elements. You can apply the same Heading animation from above to the `Heading` in this section (and even consider making this a component, weâ€™ve repeated it enough times!)

Next, weâ€™ll create a variant object for the List Container and each List Item.

```jsx
...
const list = {
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.2,
    },
  },
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
};

const item = {
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0, transition: { duration: 0.7 } },
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 40, transition: { duration: 0.7 } },
};
...
```

Weâ€™ve described two animation states on our objects: `hidden` and `visible`. We can load this object into the `motion` component using the `variants` prop. Once they are applied, they can then be referred to by label inside of the `initial` and `animate` props.

```jsx
...
<List
  initial="hidden"
          viewport={{
            amount: "some",
          }}
          whileInView="visible"
          variants={list}
        >
          {listItems.map((listItem, index) => (
            <Item
              key={index}
              variants={item}
              viewport={{
                amount: "some",
              }}
              whileInView="visible"
              initial="hidden"
            >
              A simple list item {listItem}
            </Item>
          ))}
</List>
...
```

### The ðŸ’©Â reveal

For our last section, we will use the `whileInView` and `transition` props to describe an animation that happens whenever the element is visible â€” and then plays on loop.

> Donâ€™t forget to turn your components into motion elements

```jsx
<Emoji
  whileInView={{
    rotate: 360,
    opacity: 1,
  }}
  transition={{
    repeat: Infinity,
    repeatType: "mirror",
    duration: 2,
  }}
>
  <span role="emoji">ðŸ’©</span>
</Emoji>
```

### Closing the curtain

And thatâ€™s it, with these simple tools in your arsenal youâ€™re on your way to creating butter smooth reveal animations for your next website.
