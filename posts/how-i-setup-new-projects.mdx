Like any well architected building, it’s important to get your foundation right when undertaking a new project. I’ve found that getting these few key things right at the start sets you up best for future maintaining, refactoring and reusability — your future self with thank you!

I’m a simple guy, and much of this mantra translates heavily into my system thinking when deciding on things like folder structure, typography and global color palette setup.

Let’s walk through my typical project setup and breakdown of some of the key decisions that I make when getting started.

## Split up your design into sections

- Do this before you start developing so you have an idea of the hierarchy of everything
- I like to do this by redrawing onto my sketchpad, but we can also draw red boxes around everything in some design software.

Before I even get trigger happy with `npx-create-next-app`, I like to make sure that I _understand_ the actual design that I am about to undertake. This is usually done at the point where the product designer has handed over finished mobile and desktop mockups. I find that in breaking down the design using the box method, I get a better sense of hierarchy, component use (and which need to be prepped for reuse), and NPM package considerations.

Here are some sketches from a recent website build I did:

## Start a new NextJs project

This part is pretty standard:

**Step 1**

Open the terminal and `npx create-next-app`

**Step 2**

<SyntaxHighlighter language="jsx">
  {`
    if (timeOfDay === "morning") {
      return "Brew coffee ☕️"
    } else {
      return "Crack open a beer! 🍺"
    }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Setup styled-components

- Why I like styled-components - declarative, dynamic styling with props, treats styles like components, very reusable
  Rework 👇🏾
  - We can use normal css syntax, instead of using css-in-js method. *In order to set background color, we write `background-color:red` in plain css instead of using css-in-js method(annoying) `backgroundColor="red"`.*
  - If you are a fan of sass(scss) like me, we can use sass like syntax inside the component.
  - Documentation is also pretty good.
  - Output size is small.
- Pro tips - use one styled component as the base for another
- _how to setup styled-components in a NextJs app_
  - install styled-components
  - Create \_document.js
  - Update next.config

## Apply CSS reset

- Reference Josh Comeau’s and his why
- Link to his twitter and big him up tremendously

## Typography and Colors

- Typography very important, can make or break your design.
- Setup typography in `global.css`
- Here are a few pro tips:

  - use rem.
  - line height adjustment for readability
  - import only required font weight

    s

- Create `colors.js` file with default export
  - Don’t use descriptive color names. eg blue. Use primary instead. (why)

## BONUS: Import reusable components

- Talk about how repetitive things can get
- ONce you’ve built it once, you shouldnt have to ever again
- Talk about labyrinth
- Share it as pro tip - make sure to say that it is a work in progress

## Start building the nav and footer

- Get your feet wet
- The most global components. good to get them out the way so you have them on every page
- Share some footers from lib
