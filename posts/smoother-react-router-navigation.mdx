React and React Router are a great combo when it comes to implementing navigation in websites built with React, but it can be improved. One thing that I always found to be lacking was a “buttery” feel when moving between pages. Everything always seemed to just happen without any kind of visual cues.

Today we will be improving navigation by doing two things:

1. Adding a visual cue to show when the site is loading. This will be achieved using [Pace.js](https://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/)
2. Adding a *Fade* animation using CSS so that content doesn’t just suddenly *appear*.

Let’s get started shall we!? You can find an example of what we will be building [here](https://reelgood.com/)

### **What is Pace?**

According to their website:

> Include pace.js and a CSS theme of your choice, and you get a beautiful progress indicator for your page load and ajax navigation.
>
> _No need to hook into any of your code, progress is detected automatically._

Sounds good right!?

### **1. The setup**

_For this tutorial, I’m going to assume you have already set up a react app and some sort of navigation system using react-router._

Open your terminal to the folder directory and run the following command:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    npm install pace-js pace --save
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Once this is done, open `public/index.html` and include the following script tag in the document head:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    <script src="[https://unpkg.com/pace-js@1.0.2/pace.min.js](https://unpkg.com/pace-js@1.0.2/pace.min.js)"></script>
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Now, open `src/index.js` and include the following imports:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    import 'pace-js'
    import 'pace-js/themes/yellow/pace-theme-minimal.css'
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

_The second line is the import of the theme we decided to use for pace-js. You can view all the theme demos [here](https://github.hubspot.com/pace/docs/welcome/) and then choose one of your own using this [repo](https://github.com/HubSpot/pace/tree/master/themes)._

Next, we are going to define a global CSS class which we will use on all our Page Components. Open *src/App.css* and add CSS rules as follows

<SyntaxHighlighter language="css">
  {`
    @keyframes FadeAnim {
        0% {   
            opacity: 0;
        }
        100% {   
            opacity: 1;
        }
    }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
_Feel free to adjust these values in order to achieve different fade in effects._

### **2. The Implementation**

Since Pace.js can automatically detect when a page load is occurring, all we have to do to complete the buttery smooth animation is add the “_Fade_” class to any page we want to navigate to like so:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="javascript">
  {`
    class Appextends
        Component {
            render() {
                return (
                    <div class="App Fade">
                        <!--Page Content-->
                    </div>
                    )
            }
        }
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

And that’s it! As you navigate between Page Components with the Fade class, the content will smoothly transition in and Pace.js will automatically start and stop the page load indicator as the content is loaded giving the user the sense that something is actually happening!
